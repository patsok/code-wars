# CodeWars

<br>
A repository filled with my katas made entirely with <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=plastic&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E"/>
I'm trying to solve kata every now and then. I consistently refactor and optimize code for efficiency and/or readability.

## What I learned

- How to approach a problem
